This project is an **exploration playground about different types of MCP servers with OpenAI Agent SDK**.
It shows how to create, run, and interact with agents using various MCP server configurations.
It includes a persistent memory powered by SQLite, allowing agents to store, recall, and manage conversation data over time.
Additionally, it demonstrates how agents can perform real-time web searches using the Brave Search tool, extract relevant information, and summarize insights

## Features

1. **Persistent Memory Agent (LibSQL)**  
   - Runs entirely locally.  
   - Stores and recalls conversation data.  

2. **Web Search Agent (Brave Search)**  
   - Runs locally but interacts with a web service.  
   - Fetches and summarizes real-time information.  

## Highlights

- Initialize MCP servers with different setups.  
- Create agents with instructions and custom models.  
- Run conversations and retrieve results programmatically.  
- Experiment with AI capabilities like memory persistence and web search.
